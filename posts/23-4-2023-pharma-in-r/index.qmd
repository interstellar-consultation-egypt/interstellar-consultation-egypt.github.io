## Overview

In case you are interested in using R language for developing data analysis or ML applications for bio related fields as Chemoinformatics, Drug Discovery, Bioinformatics, or Healthcare in general, the following quick survey will help you to show different cases in that already done in R:

## BioConductor

BioConductor is a great place of R packages that focuses mainly on bio related fields and a very good place to start studying R in bio. It provides open source and (open development) tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data using R. It has two releases each year, 800+ software packages, and a great and highly active user community.

The following are few resource you can start browsing to start knowing BioConductor:

-   [*BioConductor Capabilities*:](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/) This course covers BiocCnductor capabilities and it is renewable
-   [BioConductor](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor): This channel full of different cases in bio in general including all topics above

## Conferences

There are multiple annual related conferences to discuss R updates relating to these fields as:

-   [R in Pharma](https://rinpharma.com/): The conference for all things R related in the Pharma industry

-   [BioConductor Conference](https://bioc2021.bioconductor.org/)

-   [R in Medicine](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/): The R/Medicine conference and community promote the development and use of R based tools to improve clinical research and practice.
